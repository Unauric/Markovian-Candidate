The defense of freedom is the surest way to the peace we all desire. I believe that we are going to prevail because we are right, and we are defending the cause of freedom for the world. Terrorists hate our freedoms, our way of life, our opportunity to speak, our opportunity to worship, our opportunity to vote. We will fight them over there so we do not have to fight them here. We must keep our economy strong by making the tax cuts permanent. America will never forget September 11, 2001. We will not rest; we will not tire; we will not falter; and we will not fail. We must make the hard choices today to protect the long-term prosperity of our nation. My job is to protect the American people. We have a clear vision for the future, a future of peace, freedom, and opportunity. God bless the troops, and God bless the United States of America. We seek justice, not revenge. The mission is clear. We are making progress. We will finish the job we started.
