We need a change in leadership and a new strategy to tackle global challenges. I have a plan to rebuild our alliances and restore America's standing in the world. We must strengthen the middle class, invest in education, and create high-wage jobs right here at home. My commitment is to a foreign policy that respects diplomacy and global engagement. We need a modern military that is prepared for twenty-first century threats, not nineteenth-century ones. The current administration has failed to grasp the complexity of our economic recovery. We must be smart, not just tough. We must work together, not alone. I will fight for affordable healthcare for every single family. We need accountability and transparency in Washington. My policy proposes a partnership with the international community to solve climate change and poverty. Our future demands a serious and thoughtful approach.
